    {
      title: 'Clogged Gutters',
      causes: 'Over time, gutters can become clogged with leaves, debris, and dirt. This blockage prevents water from flowing freely, causing it to overflow or back up onto the roof.',
      impact: 'Water that doesnâ€™t drain properly can seep into the roof, walls, and foundation, leading to water damage, mold growth, and erosion around the base of the house.',
      diagnosis: [
        'Inspect gutters after heavy rains to check for overflowing water.',
        'Look for debris buildup in gutters or downspouts.',
        'Examine the foundation for signs of pooling water or erosion near the base of the house.'
      ]
    },
    {
      title: 'Sagging Gutters',
      causes: 'Gutters can sag due to the accumulation of water, debris, or poor installation. The added weight strains the gutter supports, pulling them away from the roofline.',
      impact: 'Sagging gutters cause improper water drainage, leading to roof leaks or damage to the siding and foundation. The gaps created by sagging can also allow water to run down the walls.',
      diagnosis: [
        'Visually inspect the gutters for uneven sections or sagging spots.',
        'Check for loose or missing fasteners along the roofline.',
        'Look for water stains on the siding where water may be spilling over the gutter edge.'
      ]
    },
    {
      title: 'Leaky Gutters',
      causes: 'Over time, gutters can develop leaks due to corrosion, cracked seams, or improper sealing. These leaks usually occur at the joints where sections of the gutter meet.',
      impact: 'Leaky gutters cause water to drip down the side of the house, damaging siding, windows, and even the foundation. Over time, it can lead to interior water damage and mold growth.',
      diagnosis: [
        'Inspect gutters during rainfall to spot leaks or dripping water.',
        'Check for rust, corrosion, or cracks at gutter joints.',
        'Look for water stains on the siding or around windows.'
      ]
    },
    {
      title: 'Improper Gutter Slope',
      causes: 'Gutters must be installed with a slight slope to allow water to flow toward the downspouts. An improper slope can cause water to pool inside the gutter.',
      impact: 'Standing water in the gutters can lead to corrosion, leaks, and gutter damage over time. It also creates an environment for mosquitoes and pests to breed.',
      diagnosis: [
        'After a rainstorm, inspect the gutters for standing water.',
        'Check the slope of the gutters by pouring water into them and observing the flow toward the downspouts.',
        'Look for sections of the gutter where water is pooling or slow to drain.'
      ]
    },
    {
      title: 'Damaged Downspouts',
      causes: 'Downspouts can become damaged due to clogs, poor installation, or physical impact. If downspouts are blocked or disconnected, water cannot drain away from the foundation.',
      impact: 'Damaged downspouts cause water to pool near the foundation, increasing the risk of basement flooding, erosion, and foundation damage.',
      diagnosis: [
        'Check for water pooling near the foundation after rainfall.',
        'Inspect downspouts for clogs, cracks, or disconnections.',
        'Ensure downspouts extend far enough from the house to direct water away from the foundation.'
      ]
    },
    {
      title: 'Rust and Corrosion',
      causes: 'Metal gutters, particularly those made from steel, can rust or corrode over time due to exposure to moisture and the elements.',
      impact: 'Corroded gutters may fail to channel water properly, resulting in leaks that damage the roof, walls, and foundation. Rusted sections may eventually break apart.',
      diagnosis: [
        'Look for rust spots or orange discoloration along the gutters.',
        'Check for signs of metal degradation or holes in the gutter system.',
        'Run water through the gutters and inspect for leaks in corroded areas.'
      ]
    },
    {
      title: 'Ice Dams',
      causes: 'In colder climates, snow and ice can accumulate in gutters, forming ice dams that prevent water from draining properly.',
      impact: 'Ice dams cause water to back up under the roof shingles, leading to leaks, roof damage, and gutter warping. The added weight of the ice can also cause gutters to pull away from the roofline.',
      diagnosis: [
        'Check gutters and downspouts for ice buildup in the winter.',
        'Inspect the roof eaves for icicles or water stains after a freeze.',
        'Look for sagging or deformed gutters due to ice accumulation.'
