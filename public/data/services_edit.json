According to the U.S. Department of Energy, effective ventilation can lower cooling expenses by up to 10% by allowing trapped hot air to escape, thereby decreasing the reliance on air conditioning systems (Energy.gov). Implementing adequate roof ventilation creates a more comfortable living environment, lowers energy bills, and extends the lifespan of your roofing materials. The National Roofing Contractors Association highlights that proper ventilation helps prevent heat-related damage, which can extend roof longevity by several years (NRCA)."
