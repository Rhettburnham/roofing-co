### **1. Important Information Missing from the Website**  
The current website (linked to Yelp) lacks critical information that could improve customer trust and engagement. Below are key elements that should be added:  
- **About Us Page**:  
  - A detailed history of the business, including the 11 years of experience and the team’s expertise.  
  - Bios for Mr. Luis Aguilar-Lopez and Ms. Erika Salinas, highlighting their roles, qualifications, and commitment to quality.  
- **Service Pages**:  
  - Dedicated pages for each service (e.g., Roof Leak Specialist, Chimney Leak Specialist, Roof Replacement, Siding Repairs) with detailed descriptions, benefits, and examples of past work.  
- **Contact Information**:  
  - A clear, easy-to-find contact form, phone number, and email address.  
  - Business hours and a map with directions to the office.  
- **Licensing and Certifications**:  
  - Display any licenses, certifications, or industry affiliations to build credibility.  
- **Testimonials and Reviews**:  
  - A dedicated section showcasing positive reviews (like the ones provided) with photos of completed projects.

### **2. Potential Concerns or Challenges Based on Reviews**  
While the reviews are overwhelmingly positive, there are subtle areas to address to ensure customer satisfaction and trust:  
- **Repetition of Services in Listings**:  
  - The services list on Yelp is repetitive and confusing. Streamline and organize the services into clear categories on the website.  
- **Long-Term Durability**:  
  - One review mentions a rodent problem five years after the initial roof replacement. Address this by emphasizing preventative measures and long-term warranties on your website.  
- **Transparency in Pricing**:  
  - While reviews praise professionalism, adding a pricing guide or cost estimator tool could further build trust and reduce hesitation for potential customers.
