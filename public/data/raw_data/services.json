Remove old shingles, underlayment, and nails.  \n2. **Decking Repair/Replacement** \u2013 Replace damaged plywood or OSB sheathing to ensure a solid base.  \n3. **Underlayment Installation** \u2013 Apply a waterproof barrier (synthetic or felt underlayment) over the decking. Install ice and water shield in vulnerable areas (e.g., eaves, valleys).  \n4. **Flashing Installation** \u2013 Install metal flashing around chimneys, vents, skylights, and roof valleys to prevent leaks.  \n5. **Starter Shingle Application** \u2013 Lay starter strips along the eaves to provide a secure base and prevent wind uplift.  \n6. **Shingle Installation** \u2013 Begin at the bottom edge, working upward in staggered rows (offsetting seams for proper water runoff). Nail according to manufacturer specs (typically 4-6 nails per shingle).  \n7. **Ridge Cap Installation** \u2013 Finish with pre-cut ridge shingles or hip-and-ridge caps for a sealed, professional look.  \n8. **Cleanup & Inspection** \u2013 Remove debris, check for loose nails, and ensure proper sealing.  \n\n### **Materials & Specifications**  \n**Shingles:** Asphalt (most common), architectural/laminated (premium), 3-tab (budget).  \n**Underlayment:** Synthetic (30-50#) or felt (15-30#).  \n**Flashing:** Galvanized steel, aluminum, or copper.  \n**Fasteners:** Galvanized or stainless steel roofing nails (1\u00bc\" to 1\u00be\").  \n\n### **Safety & Building Codes**  \nOSHA requires fall protection (harnesses, guardrails) for roofs over 6 feet.  \nLocal codes dictate nailing patterns, underlayment requirements, and fire ratings (Class A, B, or C).  \nIce & water shield is mandatory in cold climates (IRC Section R905).  \n\n### **Timeline Estimates**  \n**Tear-off & replacement:** 1-3 days (1,500\u20133,000 sq. ft. roof).  \n**Overlay (new shingles over old):** 1-2 days (not recommended due to added weight and reduced lifespan).  \n\n-- \n\n## **2.",
        "variants": "**  \n\n### **Types of Shingles**  \n**3-Tab Asphalt:** Budget-friendly, lightweight, 20-25-year lifespan.  \n**Architectural (Dimensional):** Mid-range, textured appearance, 30-50-year lifespan.  \n**Luxury Shingles (Premium):** Slate-like or designer styles (e.g., GAF Timberline HDZ, Malarkey Vista), 50+ years.  \n**Metal Shingles:** Long-lasting (50+ years), energy-efficient, but higher cost.  \n**Synthetic (Composite):** Mimics slate/wood, durable, but expensive.  \n\n### **Durability, Appearance, & Cost Comparison**  \n| Type | Cost (per sq. ft.) | Lifespan | Appearance |  \n|------|-------------------|----------|------------|  \n| 3-Tab | $1.50\u2013$3.00 | 20\u201325 yrs | Flat, uniform |  \n| Architectural | $3.50\u2013$5.50 | 30\u201350 yrs | Dimensional, textured |  \n| Luxury | $6.00\u2013$12.00 | 50+ yrs | High-end, custom colors |  \n| Metal | $7.00\u2013$14.00 | 50+ yrs | Modern, sleek |  \n\n### **Premium vs. Budget Options**  \n**Budget:** 3-tab asphalt (short-term solution).  \n**Mid-Range:** Architectural (best value).  \n**Premium:** Luxury shingles or metal (long-term investment).  \n\n-- \n\n## **3.",

Remove old siding and repair underlying sheathing if necessary.  \n2. **Weather Barrier Installation** \u2013 Apply a water-resistant barrier (e.g., house wrap or felt paper) to protect against moisture infiltration.  \n3. **Flashing & Trim Work** \u2013 Install metal or vinyl flashing around windows, doors, and corners to prevent water intrusion.  \n4. **Starter Strip Installation** \u2013 For vinyl or fiber cement siding, a starter strip ensures proper alignment and prevents warping.  \n5. **Siding Panel Installation** \u2013 Begin at the bottom, working upward, overlapping panels for proper drainage. Secure with corrosion-resistant nails or screws, leaving room for expansion.  \n6. **Finishing Touches** \u2013 Install J-channels, corner posts, and soffit/fascia trim for a polished look.  \n7. **Final Inspection** \u2013 Check for gaps, loose panels, or improper fastening to ensure compliance with building codes.  \n\n### **Materials & Specifications**  \n**Vinyl Siding:** Lightweight, UV-resistant, available in various textures (e.g., wood grain).  \n**Fiber Cement:** Durable, fire-resistant, mimics wood but requires sealing.  \n**Wood Siding:** Natural appearance, requires staining/sealing (cedar, redwood).  \n**Metal Siding (Aluminum/Steel):** Long-lasting, low-maintenance, but prone to dents.  \n**Engineered Wood:** Composite material, moisture-resistant, mimics real wood.  \n\n### **Safety & Building Code Requirements**  \nOSHA compliance for ladder/fall protection.  \nLocal building codes dictate fire ratings, wind resistance, and fastener spacing.  \nProper ventilation behind siding to prevent moisture buildup.  \n\n### **Timeline Estimates**  \nSmall home (1,500 sq. ft.): **3\u20135 days**  \nLarger homes (2,500+ sq. ft.): **1\u20132 weeks** (varies based on material complexity).  \n\n-- \n\n## **2.",

Panels are overlapped and fastened according to manufacturer specs.  \n6. **Sealing & Finishing** \u2013 Sealants are applied at seams and penetrations to prevent leaks. Trim pieces are installed for a clean, finished look.  \n7. **Final Inspection** \u2013 The roof is checked for proper fastening, alignment, and waterproofing.  \n\n### **Materials & Specifications**  \n**Metal Panels**: Typically 22-26 gauge steel, aluminum, or copper.  \n**Fasteners**: Stainless steel or galvanized screws with neoprene washers.  \n**Underlayment**: Synthetic (e.g., Tyvek\u00ae) or traditional felt (30#).  \n**Flashing**: Galvanized or aluminum step flashing, counterflashing, and drip edges.  \n\n### **Safety & Building Codes**  \nOSHA requires fall protection (harnesses, guardrails) for roofs with a pitch >4:12.  \nLocal building codes dictate fire ratings, wind uplift resistance (ASTM E1592), and snow load capacity.  \nProper ventilation and insulation must comply with energy codes (e.g., IECC).  \n\n### **Timeline Estimates**  \nSmall commercial roofs (5,000\u201310,000 sq. ft.): **1\u20132 weeks**  \nLarge installations (20,000+ sq. ft.): **3\u20136 weeks** (weather-dependent)  \n\n-- \n\n## **2.",
